The site has been cleaned up significantly. This was a good workout for the coding muscle. Once media queries are reviewed, I would like to come back and make it a bit more responsive for different screen sizes. That would leave a nice touch.

*things to improve*

-Come up with a better plan before attacking the problem

-Slow down and take some time. It is not a race and the sloppier your work, the longer it will take to debug

-COMMIT MORE OFTEN. Holy moly I just kinda refactored the whole thing in one commit.
